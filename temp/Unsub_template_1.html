      Hello [[Name]]<br />
      <br />
      If you’ve received a marketing campaign via email and would like to
      opt-out of future notifications please use the “Unsubscribe Link” at the
      bottom of the email you received.
      <br />
      <br />
      Need more help? Unsubscribing is as easy as 1-2-3!
      <br />
      <br />
      Step One:
      <br />
      <br />
      In each email we share with our readers we include our ‘unsubscribe’ link
      at the bottom. Locate and open the last email you received from ".
      $ToAddress ." and scroll down to the bottom.
      <br />
      <br />
      Step Two:
      <br />
      <br />
      Click the ‘Unsubscribe’ link and follow the process shown on the next
      page. Please note that if you use Gmail, Yahoo, AOL or Hotmail email
      services your email marked as ‘Junk’ or ‘Spam’ may be deleted
      automatically without your knowledge. Just incase we need to reference
      this email to further investigate we recommend moving the email to your
      inbox until your unsubscribe request is completed.
      <br />
      <br />
      **PLEASE NOTE: If the unsubscribe link is not clickable, you must move the
      email to your inbox. Gmail and other email providers sometimes make links
      un-clickable if it’s not in the Inbox.**
      <br />
      <br />
      Step Three:
      <br />
      <br />
      If using the unsubscribe button in your email, you will be unsubscribed
      from our email newsletter within 24 hours. If communicating with us via
      written instructions, please allow us 10 business days to process your
      request.
      <br />
      <br />
      Please know that while we’ll miss your participation and patronage we
      respect your privacy and hope you subscribe again soon.
      <br />
      <br />
      Additionally if you wish to unsubscribe via postal mail, you may do so,
      and again our address is:
