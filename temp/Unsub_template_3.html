      Greetings [[Name]]<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Need help unsubscribing? Please use one of the two following options:
      <br />
      <br />
      Method One:
      <br />
      <br />
      If you’ve received a marketing promotion via email and would like to
      opt-out of future correspondence, please use the “Unsubscribe Link”
      located at the bottom of the last email you received from us.
      <br />
      <br />
      Click the ‘To Unsubscribe please go here’ link and follow the process
      shown on the next page. Please note that if you use Gmail, Yahoo, AOL or
      Hotmail email services your email marked as ‘Junk’ or ‘Spam’ may be
      deleted automatically without your knowledge. Just incase we need to
      reference this email to further investigate we recommend moving the email
      to your inbox until your unsubscribe request is completed. By using the
      unsubscribe button in your email you will be unsubscribed from our email
      newsletter within 24 hours.
      <br />
      <br />
      **PLEASE NOTE: If the unsubscribe link is not clickable, you must move the
      email to your inbox. Some email providers make links un-clickable if it’s
      not in the inbox.**
      <br />
      <br />
      Method Two:
      <br />
      <br />
      If you wish to unsubscribe via postal mail, you may do so, and our address
      is:
      <br />
      <br />
      [[InsertAddressSpecificToEmailAccount]]
      <br />
      <br />
      Kindly note that this is a postal address only. If communicating with us
      via written instructions, please allow us 10 business days to process the
      request.
      <br />
      <br />
      For our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service agreement please refer to the
      TOS and Privacy Policy link on the site from which you received your
      marketing promotion.
      <br />
      <br />
      We hope this was helpful!
      <br />
      <br />
      Please know that while we’ll miss your participation and patronage we
      respect your privacy and hope you subscribe again soon.
